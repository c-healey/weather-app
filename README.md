       #Weather app

        ##What it does

        Displays todays weather and a five-day forecast for your location.

        ##How It works

        When you go to the weather app, it looks up your geolocation, loads up weather information from openweathermaps free api and displays it on a two-sided card.  The front side of the card has today’s weather.  Hover over the front side and is flips to the back side to show a five-day forecast. On mobile devices, today\’s weather and the five-day forecast are on one page.
        Runs best on newer Browsers.  The design uses display grid and ES6-8 not supported on all browsers.
